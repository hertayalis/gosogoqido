Noelle is a younger sister to Dewey Francis and an older sister to <strong>Michael Francis “Mickey” Jr.</strong> and <strong>Hughie Francis.</strong></p><p>Well, being surrounded by boys in the family certainly injected her with an excess of masculine energy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/noelle-1378.jpg><p>Like Noelle, her brothers Mickey and Hughie are internet stars as they have their own YouTube channel called MickeyFoley0105, whereas Dewey is employed at WWE.</p><p>Also, Mickey has the autism spectrum but is one of the most fun-loving and kind people in the family.</p><p>Apart from the familial details, the information regarding her education is mostly unknown.</p><p>Foley is an American citizen and is of white ethnic background. In the same way, she is a Sagittarius based on her birth chart.</p><h2>Noelle Foley | Age, Height, & Body Measurements</h2><p>Born in 1993 makes Noelle&nbsp; 29 years old at present. The Georgian is still young and is eager to step into wrestling before her prime time passes, although, at 29, she has already managed to achieve mild stardom mainly through her online presence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/noelle-1381.jpg><p>Simultaneously, the internet star has a magnificent height of 6’0″ (1.83 m), undoubtedly inheriting her father’s towering physique. Pertaining to her height, Noelle weighs approximately 68 kg (150 lbs).</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Camille Kostek Bio: Age, Height, Career, Net Worth, Boyfriend, IG, Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>In like manner, in pursuit of being a wrestler, the Georgian enthusiastically stays fit and hence possesses a body measurement of 35-inches of the breast, 25-inches of the waist, and 36-inches of hips.</p><p>Despite being a voracious foodie, her incredible shape is proof of how serious she is to wrestling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/noelle-1382.jpg><p>Besides, there is no denying how beautiful Foley is, and in this regard, she definitely takes after her mother.</p><p>With natural long blonde hair, icy blue eyes, and a doll-like face, it’s impossible not to fall in love with such a bombshell.</p><h2>Noelle Foley | Career: Wrestler & Modeling</h2><p>For several years now, Mick stands as an advocate of women’s wrestling. Naturally, when Noelle developed a passion for the industry, her father was bound to guide her through the hustle and bustle.</p><p>Initially, the Georgian first came into the limelight after appearing alongside her father in several TV shows and documentaries.</p><p>Beyond the Mat was one such documentary that gave insights and a behind-the-scenes peek on the ring’s dynamics and debunked the false statements that claimed wrestling to be fake.</p><p>However, until the age of 15, Noelle didn’t appear before the public’s eye after disappearing from the spotlight at just six years old.</p><p>Ultimately, at one point, Foley made a cameo in her father’s comedy special Mick Foley: Cheap Pops.</p><p>Additionally, the Georgian had the opportunity to take the WWE stage and not in the way one would imagine.</p><p>WWE is known to make unique segments apart from their great wrestling matches; as such, Noelle featured in WWE Slam Christmas alongside her father.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlise Castro Bio: Age, Parents, Ethnicity, Husband, Instagram Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Likewise, from 2016 onwards, the spring wrestler became a regular in one of her father’s shows titled Holey Foley!, which basically documents the Foley family’s everyday life.</p><p>Unfortunately for Noelle, her wrestling career took a significant halt when she sustained an injury during training.</p><p>Thus, the only WWE action she got there on was on WWE Kitchen Smackdown that pits wrestling stars against each other in a cook-off.</p><p>On the contrary, even with a wrestling career down the drain, the 27-year-old maintains her public stardom with engaging YouTube videos on her channel, which has over 50k+subscribers.</p><p>We can mainly learn about makeup tutorials, fashion reviews, and the unboxing of various channel packages.</p><h2>Noelle Foley | Concussion Syndrome</h2><p>In 2019, Foley went to a theme park with her boyfriend to make memories and have fun. At the park, their eyes came across a particular roller coaster.</p><p>Since it didn’t have any different warning than other roller coasters, the two strapped in to enjoy the ride.</p><p>Little did Noelle knew that the ride wouldn’t be as fun as she anticipated.</p><p>As soon as the roller coaster dropped, the social media influencer hit her head on the headrest very hard. Moreover, it happened a few more times.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Noelle-Foley-For-Calvin-Klein.jpg><p>Immediately after getting off the ride, the actress was nauseous, dizzy, and in a lot of pain. She had a concussion.</p><p>However, she failed to recognize it at the moment. Noelle elaborated how the thought of concussion didn’t even cross her mind.</p><p>She went through weeks of headaches before her brother suggested that it might be a concussion. Finally, after making a doctor’s appointment, it was confirmed to be a concussion.</p><p>Now, Foley suffers from Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS) and shares her story so that people don’t mistake concussions for headaches. Likewise, she uses her social media platforms to spread awareness.</p><h2>Noelle Foley Net Worth | Salary & Income</h2><p>Talking about her financial details, Noelle proudly sits on a net worth of <strong>$1 million</strong>. Frankly, it’s an impressive feat for someone whose earning is based solely on internet success.</p><p>Moreover, this fortune has neither been granted by her father nor any other external sources.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/noelle-1384.jpg><p>Indeed, in the modern world, one can make money from any outlet if they put their heart and mind into it. On the contrary, if we move onto Mick’s net worth, it certainly dwindles Noelle’s collective wealth.</p><p>To illustrate, Mick, over the years, has amassed a fortune of <strong>$18 million</strong>.</p><p>Even though Cactus jack is a retired man, he hasn’t stopped earning and to this day pockets around <strong>$2.88 million</strong> every year from writings, commentary, and other stage shows.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessie Moses Bio: Age, Ethnicity, Kids, Husband, Instagram Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Also, the once fearsome man turned out to be a tender-hearted guy.</p><p>Having to take care of his wonderful middle son, who has autism, Mick set out to do good in this world with involvements in charities like Camp Adventure&nbsp;and Make-a-Wish Foundation.</p><h2>Noelle Foley | Personal Life, Boyfriend & Relationship Status</h2><p>As much as of a social bird Noelle is, for some time now, her private was in the shadows.</p><p>Nonetheless, Foley started opening up eventually, and what we found out was that she has been dating <strong>Frank “The Clown” Mustari</strong> for six years now.</p><p>Frank became a subject to much resentment from the general mass in recent years because an “indie wrestler,” such as himself, is dating a bombshell and Mick Foley’s daughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/noelle-1380.jpg><p>However, the thick-skinned clown doesn’t need to sweat over the outrageous comments or hate as Noelle has eyes for him and him only. On top of that, Frank even has the blessing of the WWE Hall of Famer.</p><h2>Noelle Foley | Social Media Presence</h2><p>Mick Foley’s daughter is quite active on social media platforms.
