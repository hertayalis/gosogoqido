Disappointing character representation aside, this episode is ultimately satisfying.

Answer
Clear bases are used to generate deeper colours, whilst white bases are used to create the lightest hues, as seen in the diagram. A light basis generates a lighter hue than a medium base, which is the opposite of the former. The paint base controls how resistant a paint is to dirt and stains, as well as how long it will last when subjected to vigorous cleaning.</p><footer><a href=../../what-is-the-difference-between-bases-in-paint-html.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../229029-wolfgang-novogratz-parents-are-hgtv-star-html.html>Wolfgang Novogratz' Parents Are HGTV Stars What Else to Know about Actor and His Family</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
