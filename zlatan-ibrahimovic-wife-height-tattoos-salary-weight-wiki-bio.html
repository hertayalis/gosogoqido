striker has won 32 trophies during his career which ranks him as the second most decorated football player in the world.&nbsp;Ibra of Ibracadabra, as he is often called, has a loot of his own.&nbsp;He exudes superior self-confidence and thinks he is the best football player in the world.&nbsp;He presents himself as a “king”, a “lion” and even a “god”.&nbsp;Of course you would want to know more about the great footballer and there is more…</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography of Zlatan Ibrahimovic</span></strong></h2><p><span>Zlatan Ibrahimovic was born on October 3, 1981, in Malmö, Sweden.&nbsp;Her parents were interfaith as her father, Šefik Ibrahimović, was Muslim while her mother, Jurka Gravić, was Catholic.&nbsp;His siblings (some of whom are half-siblings) include two brothers and three sisters – Sanela, Sapko, Aleksander, Monika and Violeta Ibrahimovic.&nbsp;The former Barcelona and Manchester United actor started playing football when he received a pair of football boots at the age of six.&nbsp;There is no information about his high school or college education.</span></p><p><span>Ibrahimovic started his football career as a child, playing with his city’s youth clubs, including Malmö BI.&nbsp;He stole other people’s bikes simply to facilitate his quick transport to football training sessions away from home.&nbsp;But he wasn’t always keen on quitting football at some point (what a waste of talent that would have been).&nbsp;Ibrahimovic decided to look for work on the docks of his home town, a decision which saw him quit football altogether in 1996, at the age of fifteen.&nbsp;Hearing this, Malmö FF, his then manager at his original club in his hometown, advised against taking him and encouraged him to pursue his career while offering him his first professional contract.&nbsp;His commitment at this young age made him a regular in the starting teams.&nbsp;Three years later, he joined the club’s senior team for the 1999 football season, which was his first season in the Swedish top flight league.&nbsp;After two seasons in the top flight, he moved to AFC Ajax for a fee of £6.5million.</span></p><p><span>Zlatan Ibrahimovic is a national hero in his country, Sweden.&nbsp;His impact on world football is so great that his name is now a verb and can be found in the Urban Dictionary.&nbsp;“Zlatan” means to be incredibly awesome in every way and for everyone, have a big ego, and be physically or verbally skilled.&nbsp;He is fluent in five foreign languages, including Italian, English and Spanish.&nbsp;His native language, Swedish and Bosnian, completes the figure.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Salary and net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ibra has amassed enormous wealth over the years through his beloved sport.&nbsp;After playing in Italy, Spain, England and the United States, the trip was a real madness for the superstar.&nbsp;For example, his one-year contract which he signed with Manchester United, England in 2016 was worth nearly £19million.&nbsp;However, he took a significant pay cut (95 per cent) to make the move to the US with LA Galaxy where his annual salary is $1.56m (£850,000), which works out to $29,400 per week (16,000 per week).</span></p><p><span>His wealth doesn’t just come from playing in the peloton, the former Juventus striker also earns thanks to his many endorsements from companies such as Volvo and sports giant Nike.&nbsp;His sponsorship deal with Nike, worth more than $2 million a year, is expected to run for four years (2015-2019).&nbsp;In 2016, he launched his own sportswear brand – AZ Sportswear.&nbsp;Ibrahimovic also offers a free-to-download Android game called ‘Zlatan Legends’, available for in-app purchases.</span></p><p><span>Besides the above, Zlatan IbrahimovicHe also has his own brand of perfume and aftershave which he unveiled through his Instagram account.&nbsp;He lavishes his money on fast cars and properties.&nbsp;Ibrahimovic owns a Lamborghini Gallardo, Maserati Grand Tourismo, Ferrari Enzo and Audi S8, with all four cars worth more than $2.8 million.&nbsp;He has properties in his hometown of Malmö, Paris, New York, Miami and Stockholm.</span><br><span>In 2015, according to Forbes, he was worth $39.1 million, but that has grown astronomically, with his net worth currently hovering between $110 million and $160 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been with his long-time partnerHelena Seger, since 2002, is the mother of his two sons – Maximilian Ibrahimovic and Vincent Ibrahimovic, born on September 22, 2006 and March 6, 2008, respectively.&nbsp;Ibrahimovic is 11 years younger than Seger but that hasn’t stopped their love.&nbsp;According to reports, the pair tied the knot in a secret wedding (which is reportedly nothing like Zlatan Ibrahimovic), but the lovebirds haven’t spoken about it publicly except in interviews in which Seger calls Ibrahimovic ” husband”.</span></p><p><span>Helena Seger is a Swedish model and business executive born on August 25, 1970 in Lindesberg, Sweden.&nbsp;She was relatively unknown until her association with the enigmatic football star, Zlatan Ibrahimovic.&nbsp;The millionaire businesswoman who started her career as an actress has a degree in economics.&nbsp;She was 17 when she worked as a bartender and when she realized she was being complimented for her looks, she got into modeling.&nbsp;She also became an actress at some point before finding a job at Bonnier Presenta.&nbsp;Seger has two siblings, a brother, Henrik, and a sister, Karin.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Size weight</span></strong></h2><p><span>Zlatan Ibrahimovic is a Swedish giant!&nbsp;He is a leader on the football field due to his size.&nbsp;He has an athletic build and it’s something he continues to work on to keep himself fit.&nbsp;No wonder he’s still able to play at such an age.&nbsp;His training routine is such that he focuses weekly on the upper and lower body and trains it even further in the off season.&nbsp;Ibra is 195 cm (6 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 91 kg (201 lb).&nbsp;His other measurements are 42½” (chest), 15¼” (biceps) and 35½” (waist)</span></p><h2><strong><span>Ibrahimovic’s tattoos</span></strong></h2><p><span>The former Swedish striker has several tattoos inked on almost all upper body parts – abdomen, arms, back, wrists etc.&nbsp;Although most of them are permanently inked, some others have been temporarily inked to create the desired effect.&nbsp;But the underline is that all of his tattoos have their meanings.&nbsp;The numbers engraved on Ibrahimovic’s right wrist are the date of birth of each male member of his family, including his father, brothers and two sons.&nbsp;He calls them the “Zlatan Ibrahimovic code”.&nbsp;On the upper part of his right arm are his father’s name “Sefik” and the names of his sons in Arabic letters.</span></p><p><span>Quite dramatically, he has the opposite of the tattoos he has on his right hand over the left.&nbsp;On his left wrist are the birth dates of his mother and his sister, Sanela.&nbsp;His mother’s name, “Jurka”, is inked in Arabic letters on his left bicep.&nbsp;When asked why he chose to tattoo women on the left, he said it was because women were closest to his heart.</span></p><p><span>Just under his right arm are two playing cards and a tattooed dragon in red ink that seems to reference the warrior side of his personality.&nbsp;On his left shoulder is a koi fish inked in gray.&nbsp;Koi fish have been known to pass through obstacles when swimming through water and Ibra says he has learned to pass through obstacles in his life.&nbsp;The choice of gray over orange for the koi fish is because it is the gray koi fish that are normally wild, unlike the orange koi fish found in ponds.&nbsp;The eagle feather on his right shoulder symbolizes endurance and strength.</span></p><p><span>Ibrahimovic has a ‘clap back’ tattoo.&nbsp;For the media and tabloids who could say and write what they want about him or the fans who could boo him whenever they want, his answer is the tattoo on his belly, which reads: “Only God can judge”.&nbsp;At Manchester United, he had an image of a fierce-looking lion’s head embedded on his back.&nbsp;It also has Leonardo da Vinci’s “Vitruvian Man” on its back, the Maori tribal symbol and an image of a Buddhist monk.</span></p><p><span>On February 14, 2015, while playing for ParisSaint-Germain in a Ligue 1 game against French club Caen, Ibrahimovic took off his t-shirt and revealed 50 names of temporarily starved people with an inker on his abdomen.&nbsp;He did this to draw the world’s attention to the 805 million people who are fighting against hunger in the world.&nbsp;His plan succeeded because the next morning, the names of the people appeared on all the reference French newspapers.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Zlatan Ibrahimovic is the only player to register</span></strong></h2><p><span>These are not Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s only records in football, but these are the records that only he holds for things he has done alone.&nbsp;The records are from his time in all the different leagues (five of them) he played in during his illustrious career.</span></p><p><span>Zlatan Ibrahimovic is the top scorer for his country, Sweden, and the only Swedish player to score in three consecutive UEFA European Championships.</span></p><p><span>He won 13 league titles in four different leagues: Eredivisie, Serie A, La Liga, Ligue 1. The only player to achieve such a feat.</span></p><p><span>Ibra has scored in nine different derbies across six leagues.&nbsp;The only player to have done so.</span></p><p><span>Away in the English Premier League, Ibra scored 25,000th league goal and became the oldest player to score 15 goals in a season.&nbsp;He was 35 years and 125 days old when he scored the 15th goal.</span></p><p><span>He scored in his first three EPL appearances for Manchester United and is the only player to do so in club history.</span></p><p><span>After playing for Paris Saint-Germain in the French Ligue 1, he became the only player to be the league’s top scorer for three seasons and the all-time top scorer in Ligue 1.</span></p><p><span>He is the only French Ligue 1 player to have scored up to 38 goals in a season.&nbsp;He also holds the record for the fastest hat-trick in Ligue 1 with 9 minutes.</span></p><p><span>At Barcelona, ​​he became the only player to score in his first five Spanish La Liga games.</span></p><p><span>He is the only player to line up for seven different UEFA Champions League teams and score for six of them.&nbsp;The teams are Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, ​​AC Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United.&nbsp;He hasn’t scored a goal in the UCL for Manchester United.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiynJbBorqMopmrmZieurDCyJxksKGWmnqpscign61lpJbBtbvOrGSsmZyWv7p51p6goKCkYsSqt8hmmaKnXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzlatan-ibrahimovic-wife-height-tattoos-salary-weight-wiki-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fzlatan-ibrahimovic-wife-height-tattoos-salary-weight-wiki-bio.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fzlatan-ibrahimovic-wife-height-tattoos-salary-weight-wiki-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fzlatan-ibrahimovic-wife-height-tattoos-salary-weight-wiki-bio.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzlatan-ibrahimovic-wife-height-tattoos-salary-weight-wiki-bio.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzlatan-ibrahimovic-wife-height-tattoos-salary-weight-wiki-bio.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lynda-carter-kids.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lynda-carter-kids.html>All About James and Jessica Carter Altman</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./walter-gait-n.html>Walter Gaitn</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./walter-gait-n.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
