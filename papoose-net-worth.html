Papoose net worth is always increasing, which is due to the fact of the hard work as well.</p><p>The artist has already released 29 mixtapes, 11 singles and, two studios. The success and the value of the artist are always on the run to the top. To know about the artist will surely provide motivation as well as fun facts. So keep hanging till the end to know more about the artist.</p><p>But before directly entering into the life of the performer, let’s know some quick facts!</p><h2>Papoose: Quick Facts</h2><table class=table><tbody><tr><th>Full Name</th><td>Shamale Mackie</td></tr><tr><th>Net Worth</th><td>$300,000</td></tr><tr><th>Date of Birth</th><td>1978 /03 /05</td></tr><tr><th>Nickname</th><td>Papoose</td></tr><tr><th>Marital Status</th><td>Married</td></tr><tr><th>Birthplace</th><td>Bedford, USA</td></tr><tr><th>Ethnicity</th><td>African-American</td></tr><tr><th>Profession</th><td>Rapper & songwriter</td></tr><tr><th>Nationality</th><td>American</td></tr><tr><th>Eye color</th><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Hair color</th><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><th>Wife</th><td>Remy Ma</td></tr><tr><th>Parents</th><td>N/A</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>&nbsp;Papoose Net Worth</h2><p>Papoose is the aspiring American rappers who surely is making a name for himself. The net worth is estimated to be <strong>$300,000</strong>. The worth will undoubtedly increase with the number of songs that are being released with time.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mercedes Javid Married Relationship With Tommy Feight >></a></h4><p>However, the net worth of Papoose is due to the album sales and the tours that come along with it.</p><h2>Papoose Wiki-Bio</h2><p><strong>Shamale Mackie,</strong> AKA Papoose, was born on March 5, 1978, in Bedford, USA. The artist is basically of a secretive nature, so childhood information is not known to the general public.</p><p>Additionally, there is no information regarding his parents as well. The assumptions can be made that the artist surely had a hard childhood, so he doesn’t want to reveal the parents as well as the sibling’s name.</p><h2>Papoose Career</h2><p>The man’s name came to fame when he appeared in Kool G raps album Roots of evil in 1998. The name of the single in 1999 was called A thug connection. The need to make a name by own effort didn’t work that well, though.</p><p>The hunger of music surely was there, but no big records signed him. All in despair, the artist started making his mixtapes. In one of the instances, the artist went to the HOT 97 office and presented one of the mixtapes to <strong>DJ Kay Slay.&nbsp;</strong> Kay was impressed by the Alphabetical slaughter and signed him to Street sweepers&nbsp;entertainment label.</p><h2>Rise to Prominence</h2><p>The association with Street sweepers was just the start. The rapper produced a prolific number of mixtapes between 2004 and 2006. On 24th August 2006, the good news came through, and Jive Records signed the performer. The album called The Nacirema Dream came through.</p><p>The bond was not so well, and Kay Slay and Papoose left Jive records. The artist was hot and cold in his career but again hogged the limelight after appearing in Busta Rhymes titled Touch it. The signing of the deal went to Flipmode as well.</p><p>Papoose announced his debut album would be the Naricema Dream and scheduled to release on March 5, 2013. The album release got great positive reviews and made its name number 97 on the Billboard 200.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapper Lil Durk: Net Worth, Songs, Album, Career, Age, Wife, and Kids, Social Media >></a></h4><p>Shamale performed his third single in his debut album Get at me with <strong>Ron</strong> <strong>Browz</strong> on June 2, 2013. On October 4, 2013, the artist announced the plan to release a mixtape and did so in 2014. The album was Hoodie season.</p><p>The music release lap went on, and in 2014 the artist went on to collaborate with international producer <strong>Swissvory</strong> and west coast rapper <strong>C</strong> <strong>Tru</strong> on track name How we roll.</p><p>On September 16, 2014, the single went on rotation to MTV.</p><h2>Awards</h2><p>The artist has given the industry quite remarkable music to enjoy on. The list of awards is less to the works done, though.</p><p>In 2005 the artist went on to get the Justo mixtape awards in the category of Best underground artist.</p><h2>Marriage of Papoose</h2><p>One of the most peculiar types of friendship that will ever take place is Shamale and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Remy Ma</a>. Remy went into custody and jail for the shooting that took place on July 13, 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/papoose-195.png><p>The couple decided to marry in 2008, but it was not successful due to the police custody. The lovebirds took it to the next level and tied the knot in jail.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yo Gotti Net Worth, Age, Kids, Album, Wiki-Bio, Dark Side >></a></h4><p>The couple gave relationship goals to the fans as Papoose tried to steal a key to the jail and get married.
