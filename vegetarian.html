It was so fun and relaxing, but when we got back, I realized just how busy the next few months are going to be. Thankfully, I have a full arsenal of healthy meal prep ideas to help us get through it. üôÇ In case you‚Äôre also having a busy fall, I‚Äôm sharing over 60 of my healthy meal prep ideas today. They include meal prep recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner,‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This breakfast burrito recipe is my ideal weekend breakfast. I love it because it‚Äôs fun, fresh, filling, and healthy, and it‚Äôs also a great way to use up odds and ends of ingredients I have leftover from recipe testing (or, you know, just making dinner) during the week. That half bunch of cilantro? Gone. The last little bit of cabbage? In it goes! Random black beans or avocado? This breakfast burrito is starting to sound good‚Ä¶ Breakfast Burrito Recipe Ingredients I make this breakfast burrito recipe a little differently every time, but no matter what, I always start with these‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It‚Äôs game day week! Not that we‚Äôre big sports fans, but I&nbsp;am a big fan of any day where it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable to eat all of the spicy, salsa-smothered, avocado-filled foods that I crave. So I‚Äôm sharing my healthier versions of traditional party favorites that don‚Äôt sacrifice in flavor because, well, foods like avocados, black beans, spicy peppers, and fresh salsa just taste good and are good for you! Chipotle Cauliflower Nachos with Pineapple Salsa&nbsp;(pictured above) The star of this nacho recipe is the oozy, smoky chipotle cauliflower ‚Äúcheese.‚Äù Yep, that‚Äôs right, the queso you see pictured is actually a‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>This is how I feel about summer cooking: I don‚Äôt want to spend tons of time in the kitchen, but I DO want to make meals at home using all of the seasonal produce that is so stunning at this time of year. The nice thing about summer cooking is that since the ingredients are so wonderful, you don‚Äôt have to do much to them in order to make a great dish.

It‚Äôs been exceptionally beautiful in Austin lately which makes me want to cook (or in some cases, just assemble) meals that are light and fresh and full of green things. Here are some of my favorites that I‚Äôve been in the mood for lately. Click on the photos or the links to go to the full recipes.

I know the Super Bowl is this Sunday but I have no clue who‚Äôs playing and if I had to guess (without googling it), I‚Äôd embarrass myself by naming teams from the wrong sport. But sportsball aside, here are a bunch of taco-nacho-ey-pizza-ish recipes that you might consider serving this weekend. I‚Äôd be game to eat any of these‚Ä¶ game or no game. pictured above:&nbsp;Super Stuffed Chipotle Sweet Potatoes pictured above:&nbsp;Healthy Loaded Vegan Nachos Mango Goji Guacamole / Sweet Potato Avocado‚Ä¶</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>It‚Äôs January, which is like Christmas here in healthy food blogger land. Green smoothies, fresh bowls of vegetables, and hearty stews are all over social media. There‚Äôs not a cookie in sight and we don‚Äôt care because gorgeous healthy food is in abundance. For me, eating lighter doesn‚Äôt require juice cleanses or food fasts. I don‚Äôt like to feel hungry or deprived so instead I turn to&nbsp;recipes like these, a collection of my personal favorite&nbsp;plant-forward recipes that are both delicious and satisfying.

Five minutes ago it was May, and all of a sudden back-to-school supplies are on store shelves. Which shouldn‚Äôt matter to me ‚Äì it‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve been in school ‚Äì but the thought of notebooks and number two pencils still sends a little chill up my spine.&nbsp;No matter how old I am, I‚Äôll never be quite ready to let the summer go.

I don‚Äôt do a bunch of heavy weekend batch cooking, but&nbsp;I DO like to prep just a few basics that can be worked into versatile meals throughout the week. If I spend just a little time, I find that I can set myself up for a healthy week ahead. And because chopping vegetables in silence is no fun, I‚Äôm partnering with Audible&nbsp;to share a few of my favorite foodie ‚Äúreads‚Äù that I like to listen to while I work.
