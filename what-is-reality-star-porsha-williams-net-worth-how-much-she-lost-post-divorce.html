For reality star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Porsha Williams</strong></a>, it did both.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=512 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>Imagining a time before Porsha Williams joined The Real Housewives of Atlanta is like imagining a bygone era. The American TV personality has become such a staple of the show that when you think of one, you immediately think of the other. Upon joining the cast of Atlanta housewives in 2012, we knew Williams as the granddaughter of civil rights leader Rev. Hosea Williams and wife to NFL football star Kordell Stewart. Even with big names like those attached to her, Williams‚Äô big personality was all her own.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>The years between 2012 and 2014 were some of the harshest for Williams, whose reputation and net worth suffered as a result of a very public divorce from her NFL husband and an equally public meltdown at the season six reunion of The Real Housewives of Atlanta.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-09-at-10.51.09-AM.png><p data-characters=769 data-current-count=769 data-injectable=true>The reality star‚Äôs net worth, which was presumed to be around $16 million during the time of her NFL marriage, tanked drastically, but it was her public meltdown at the season six Real Housewives of Atlanta reunion that had lasting consequences. At the reunion, Williams <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">physically attacked</a> co-star Kenya Moore after Moore provoked Williams by yelling in her face with a megaphone. Williams yanked Moore by the hair, slammed her to the ground, and dragged her across the floor. Needless to say, Bravo took swift and immediate action by ejecting Williams from the reunion and the show as a whole. Once the star of the show, Williams then became a friend of the stars, occasionally popping up in an episode or two the following season, no longer a main cast member.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>From reportedly having a $16 million net worth and earning $600-$800 thousand from season six of Real Housewives to getting booted from the show, Williams went from hero to zero faster than you can say ‚ÄòGeorgia peach.‚Äô It‚Äôs been eight years since her divorce and fall from grace, but what does life look like for Williams now, and has her net worth recovered?</p><h3 id=h-what-is-porsha-williams-net-worth-how-much-did-she-lose-post-divorce data-injectable=false>What is Porsha Williams‚Äô net worth? How much did she lose post-divorce?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Author üìö (@porsha4real)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Being married to an NFL star&nbsp;means more than just free tickets to football games. The lucrative career earned Williams a net worth of presumably $16 million, and as is usually the case with big marriages, that also meant a big divorce. However, when it came time to divide the finances, the reality star surprisingly walked away with nothing.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>That‚Äôs right, the Real Housewife, whose net worth was once presumably $16 million, walked away from her marriage with zero, zilch, nada. However, as she is quick to point out, it wasn‚Äôt that she didn‚Äôt get anything; it was that she didn‚Äôt ask for anything. In an interview with Bethenny Frankel on the talk show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethenny</a>, Williams said:</p><p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for anything. You know, right now in the press it‚Äôs ‚Äòoh Porsha didn‚Äôt get anything, poor Porsha‚Äô, and people are feeling sorry for me because I didn‚Äôt get anything, and they think we went to trial and I lost. I didn‚Äôt go to trial. I chose not to go to court, so there was no judgement‚Ä¶ The only thing I want him to do is to pay for my hospital bills because we didn‚Äôt have insurance ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt have insurance ‚Äì he didn‚Äôt have insurance on me or insurance on his son‚Ä¶ Oh yeah, I‚Äôm good‚Ä¶ I have health insurance now, I mean I‚Äôm completely independent.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=597 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>The clean break from her marriage and her demotion from The Real Housewives of Atlanta saw Williams go from lavish to lacking, with a net worth now substantially slashed. To this day, her net worth remains only around $400- $500 thousand. Of course, that doesn‚Äôt mean she hasn‚Äôt been hard at work. After her hiatus from season seven of The Real Housewives of Atlanta due to her public meltdown, Williams returned for season eight as a main cast member and remained as such all the way through season 12. Additionally, she created her own company, Go Naked Hair, a luxury hair company.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>Around the time of season 11, it was reported that Williams had begun earning close to $1.2 million per season. One would think that her Real Housewives raise, in conjunction with her business ventures, would put her net worth back in the millions, but that was not the case. As it stands, her public net worth still sits around $500 thousand. Of course, income doesn‚Äôt always equal net worth, and there can be many other financial factors at play here.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=635 data-current-count=935 data-injectable=true>In Nov. 2021, Williams authored her first book, The Pursuit of Porsha. In it, she discussed everything from her civil rights background to her struggles with fertility and miscarriages. She also included behind-the-scenes peeks at her time on The Real Housewives of Atlanta over the years, including several juicy bits of drama we hadn‚Äôt known before. The release of the book marked a significant change for the reality star, who announced that she would not be returning for season 13 of The Real Housewives of Atlanta. Instead, she would star in her own show, The Real Housewives of Atlanta: Porsha‚Äôs Family Matters on Bravo.</p><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>The spin-off series solely focuses on Williams and her extended family, which includes her ex-fianc√© and father to her daughter, Dennis McKinley, as well as her current fianc√©, Simon Guobadia. But staring in a new show and authoring a new book isn‚Äôt all that the American TV personality has been doing. She‚Äôs also been running and promoting an affordable sheets line called Pampered by Porsha, and if that wasn‚Äôt enough, she took to social media to fill fans in on her next career move, which appears to involve acting.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Author üìö (@porsha4real)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>Standing side by side with John Legend, Williams captioned the photo by saying ‚ÄúHonored‚Äù and used hashtags like #actress, #bookedandbusy, and #highervibrations, leading us to believe she might be headed to the silver screen or to the TV screen in a new acting role.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=false>With her toes tipped in various waters, Williams has proven herself more than just an American reality star with a big personality, but also a savvy businesswoman. With over 6.9 million followers on Instagram, the 40-year-old author uses her platform to advocate for social change, share a glimpse into her private life, and, as always, promote her businesses. Although her net worth remains at a puzzling $500 thousand, we have a feeling it won‚Äôt stay that way for long.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZaKarq2107JkrKyRp3qxu9Gsn5plp565rbXApqpmppWperi70a2fZqCfrHquwcKhZKyglWK5sL%2FTZqeoq6RisarCzquanmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-reality-star-porsha-williams-net-worth-how-much-she-lost-post-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-reality-star-porsha-williams-net-worth-how-much-she-lost-post-divorce.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-reality-star-porsha-williams-net-worth-how-much-she-lost-post-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-reality-star-porsha-williams-net-worth-how-much-she-lost-post-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-reality-star-porsha-williams-net-worth-how-much-she-lost-post-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-reality-star-porsha-williams-net-worth-how-much-she-lost-post-divorce.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chloe-lattanzi-siblings-meet-sarah-toby.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chloe-lattanzi-siblings-meet-sarah-toby.html>Chloe Lattanzi Siblings: Meet Sarah, Toby</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./weird-al-yankovic-net-worth-html.html>What Is 'Weird Al' Yankovic's Net Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./weird-al-yankovic-net-worth-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
