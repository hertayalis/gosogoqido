That year, he debuted professionally with the Yankees 1 of the Dominican Summer League (DSL).</p><p>Baseball America listed him as the Yankees’ ninth-best prospect prior to the 2014 season. Before getting called up to the Class A-Advanced Florida State League’s Tampa Yankees, Severino began the season with Charleston.</p><p>Due to Michael Pineda’s injury sustained in late July and the Yankees’ inability to acquire a starting pitcher before the trade deadline, general manager Brian Cashman declared that Severino’s upcoming start would take place at Yankee Stadium in the major leagues against the Yankees’ main rival, the Boston Red Sox.</p><p>Severino was a member of the Yankees starting rotation at the start of 2016.

On February 27, he had the procedure done formally and had a bone chip removed from his right elbow.</p><p>As Severino recovered from Tommy John surgery, he was put on the 60-day injured list on February 22, 2021. Severino was out until August after sustaining a groin injury on June 12, 2021, while in rehab with the Hudson Valley Renegades.</p><p>As Severino became the Yankee with the longest contract, Brett Gardner decided not to resign for the 2022 campaign.
