There was no clear idea for fans as to where this new faction was headed. The members of the Dark Order didn’t know very much either.</p><p>Brodie Lee was eventually introduced as the Exalted One. Mr. Brodie Lee<a href=#> recently spoke about how he had to piece the Dark Order back together</a> by that point as the direction for the faction really went a different place than originally intended.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sitting Ringside with David Penzer</a>, Evil Uno discussed AEW’s original intention behind the Dark Order. He admitted that nobody knew what the final direction was. The Exalted One wasn’t even explained, but they knew that it was a reveal that needed to be dragged out.</p><p>“At first when we first started doing the cult stuff, we had no clear picture of what the final direction was.&nbsp;We were in the infancy of this because the TV just started and we were one of the characters that needed to be explained.&nbsp;Initially, we never knew who the Exalted One was going to be. All we knew is we were going to drag this out until we had a reveal.&nbsp;Before the reveal, I think it was maybe a month beforehand, if not a little earlier, we had inklings it was going to be Brodie Lee.”</p><p>“Honestly, we were very happy with that because I’ve known Brodie for over 15 years now and we are good friends. I knew if he came in, he would take care of us and it would work. There definitely were some other names that were thrown in the hat as potential ones. I think most of them have come out online. Matt Hardy was implied at one point and was a maybe for about 2 days and then we decided it wasn’t. But, we used the mystery and the fact his contract was expiring that we tried to entice people into thinking it was him because it seemed like the most obvious subject.”</p><p>“I heard that Marty Scurll was also a potential but no one ever discussed it with us. I know Dr. Luther did some interviews and promos as a potential leader as well when it was in its infancy, but Brodie Lee was the concrete choice for the last month before the reveal.”</p><p>AEW toyed with other ideas for the Dark Order’s leader. Brodie Lee seemed to be the perfect fit. Not only did he already have a history with the Dark Order members, but he also added a special touch that would have been hard to replicate if AEW went any other direction in regards to the Dark Order’s Exalted One.</p><p>Thanks to <a href=#>Wresting News</a> for the quote</p><p>September 21, 2020 1:45 pm</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
