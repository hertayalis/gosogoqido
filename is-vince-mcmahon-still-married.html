Hulk Hogan, The Undertaker, The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin, John Cena, Becky Lynch, the Macho Man Randy Savage, the list goes on and on and on. However, there's one controversial figure who's been a constant for the pro-wrestling organization, and that's Vince McMahon. There are tons of questions surrounding the <a href=#>WWE</a> CEO, and a big one has to do with his personal life. Namely: Is he still married?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Yes, Vince McMahon is still married to his wife, Linda.</h2><p>Vince McMahon and Linda Edwards were married in 1966 and they have two children together: Shane and Stephanie. Vince is all about having his family a part of his business as well. Shane, Stephanie, and Linda have all been featured prominently in various WWE storylines, with the four of them sometimes either feuding with one another or plotting together for some nefarious pro-wrestling purposes.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: WWE</span></figure><p>Linda McMahon played a major part in establishing the WWE as the premiere professional wrestling brand during her time as CEO and a part-time performer. She also heavily campaigned as a conservative candidate for a Senate seat in Connecticut from September 16, 2009, until November 4, 2010, but ultimately lost to Democrat Richard Blumenthal.</p><p>She'd run again in 2012 but would lose to Chris Murphy.</p><p>Her campaign slogan was one that would seem like a familiar talking point, as a similar notion was often used by Donald Trump which helped him secure the 2016 presidential election: "A businesswoman, not a politician, for Connecticut."</p><p>This makes sense as Linda would go on to become an official for the Trump administration. She'd also go on to serve as the 25th administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Democratic Senator Approves of Linda McMahon As Head Of SBA <a href=#>https://t.co/IdUy4UdckP</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7DnfHrIjcg</a></p>‚Äî Washington Free Beacon (@FreeBeacon) <a href=#>December 8, 2016</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How tall is Vince McMahon?</h2><p>If you've ever seen Vince perform in the WWE, you've probably been amazed at the man's size and stature. He's in phenomenal shape, and not just for someone who was born in 1945. At 6'2" and 248 lbs, Vince, at least visually, could hold his own with some of the in-ring performers of the WWE.</p><p>Although many of his matches would ultimately become one-sided beatdowns, as there was a twisted pleasure in seeing the "boss man" be on the receiving end of a shellacking from the Texas Rattlesnake or the Great One, Vince never looked like he was out of place in the ring.</p><p>Vince's son-in-law and WWE living legend Triple H divulged Vince's insane work ethic.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>‚ÄúTHE BEAST IS BACK!!‚Äù</p><p>Vince McMahon plugging Donkey Kong Country is just fun. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZzwFNWGb5a</a></p>‚Äî RetroMania Wrestling (@RetrosoftStudio) <a href=#>August 30, 2020</a></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sportskeeda</a> reported The Game as saying on a podcast in April 2021: "Look, Vince is incredible. And you can say, in every level, he's 75+, his work ethic is greater than anybody I've ever seen. Still to this day, he's in the office first thing in the day, he's there all day, he's meeting with writers till 1 in the morning, 2 in the morning, and he goes downstairs and trains, his trainer is there at ungodly hours. He goes downstairs at 2 a.m. and gets after it. He doesn't sleep that much, still trains like that, still eats ‚Äî very particular about his food, he's just a machine. He's just a very disciplined person and his work ethic is second to none. It's most people that work in this company, I think long term, there's just a burnout factor. It's hard to hang with him for a long period of time. If you're on the same schedule he's on, it's 24/7."</p><p>Superstars even comment on Vince's prowess in the weight room, stating how the CEO at his peak squatting days would put up 700 lbs, something that astounds Sheamus: "The guy‚Äôs a machine, mate. I‚Äôve heard stories of him squatting nearly 700 pounds, which I can‚Äôt do. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been able to squat 700 pounds!" Sheamus told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">JOE</a> in 2020.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Vince McMahon is 75 years old and still pumping iron in the gym. üî•üí™üèª <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/60L8xeqkMO</a></p>‚Äî üëëAdam Goldbergüëë (@adamgoldberg28) <a href=#>March 21, 2021</a></figure><p>And even though Y2J has parted ways with the WWE, he still has a tremendous amount of respect for Vince's work ethic when it comes to pumping iron.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#AEW</a>'s <a href=#>@IAmJericho</a> had major praise for Vince McMahon for still hitting the gym at his age.<a href=#>https://t.co/gIxD3dQ8dG</a></p>‚Äî Sportskeeda Wrestling (@SKWrestling_) <a href=#>March 23, 2021</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwsinmp5lnZi6orTOp2SsrJmhuW65wKupop2U</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-vince-mcmahon-still-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-vince-mcmahon-still-married.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-vince-mcmahon-still-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-vince-mcmahon-still-married.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-vince-mcmahon-still-married.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-vince-mcmahon-still-married.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vultures-2-release-date-confirmed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vultures-2-release-date-confirmed.html>Vultures 2 release date, confirmed</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./shaun-ryder-daughter-meet-coco-sian-ryder.html>Shaun Ryder Daughter: Meet Coco Sian Ryder</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./shaun-ryder-daughter-meet-coco-sian-ryder.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
