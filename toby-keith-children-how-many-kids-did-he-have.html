Following his passing, search queries have primarily focused on his character and his familial ties. Consequently, we have directed our attention towards his children in this comprehensive report.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-toby-keith><strong>Who is Toby Keith?</strong></h2><p>Toby Keith was an American country music singer, songwriter, actor, and record producer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-toby-keith-biography><strong>Toby Keith biography</strong></h2><p>Keith was born in Clinton, Oklahoma, to Carolyn Joan (née Ross) and Hubert K. Covel Jr. He has a sister and a brother. The family resided in Fort Smith, Arkansas, for a few years during Keith’s grade school years, but later relocated to Moore, Oklahoma, a suburb of Oklahoma City.</p><p>During his younger years, before the move to Moore, Keith would spend his summers visiting his grandmother in Fort Smith. It was during these visits that he developed an interest in the musicians who performed at his grandmother’s establishment, Billie Garner’s Supper Club. Keith would help out with odd jobs at the club and eventually started playing with the band on the bandstand. At the age of eight, he received his first guitar.</p><p>After settling in Moore, Keith attended Highland West Junior High and Moore High School. During his time in high school, he played as a defensive end on the football team.</p><p>Upon graduating from Moore High School, Keith began working in the oil fields as a derrick hand. Through hard work and dedication, he climbed the ranks and eventually became an operation manager. Despite his job in the oil industry, Keith pursued his passion for music by forming the Easy Money Band with his friends Scott Webb, Keith Cory, David “Yogi” Vowell, Danny Smith, and a few others. The band performed at local bars, but Keith would sometimes have to leave in the middle of a concert if he was called to work in the oil field.</p><p>In 1998, Keith signed with DreamWorks Records Nashville and released his breakthrough single “How Do You Like Me Now?!” in 1999.</p><p>This song, which was also the title track of his album, became the number-one country song of 2000 and marked the beginning of several chart-topping hits during his time with DreamWorks Nashville. His subsequent albums, Pull My Chain, Unleashed, and Shock’n Y’all, each produced three more number-one hits and achieved 4× Platinum certification. In 2004, Keith released a second Greatest Hits package, followed by Honkytonk University.</p><p>After DreamWorks closed in 2005, Keith established his own label, Show Dog Nashville, which later merged with Universal South Records to form Show Dog-Universal Music in December 2009.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-toby-keith-health-issues-and-cause-of-death><strong>Toby Keith health issues and cause of death</strong></h2><p>Keith revealed in June 2022 that he had received a stomach cancer diagnosis towards the end of the previous year. Over the last six months, he has endured chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery as part of his treatment. In a press release issued in December 2022, Keith candidly expressed that his struggle with cancer had taken a significant toll on his well-being. Tragically, Keith passed away peacefully in his sleep on February 5, 2024, at the age of 62.</p><p>His social media sites and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>&nbsp;announced his death early Tuesday, February 6, 2023. The sites said he “passed peacefully last night on February 5th, surrounded by his family. He fought his fight with grace and courage. Please respect the privacy of his family at this time.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-are-toby-keith-children><strong>Who are Toby Keith children?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/toby-keith-tricia-lucus-1-fbf75363af9f4e4caad1fa34e1a9f940.jpg><p>Toby Keith is the proud father of three children, whom he shares with his wife Tricia Lucus.
