They’re working hard. They can’t afford to send their kids to college in many instances. They can’t afford child care for their little babies. They’re worried to death about retirement.” <strong>– Bernie Sanders</strong></p><p>“What being a socialist means is… that you hold out… a vision of a society where poverty is absolutely unnecessary, where international relations are not based on greed… but on cooperation… where human beings can own the means of production and work together rather than having to work as semi-slaves to other people who can hire and fire.” <strong>– Bernie Sanders</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-political-lessons-from-bernie-sanders></span>2 Political Lessons From Bernie Sanders&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Now that you know all about Bernie Sanders’ net worth and how he achieved success; let’s take a look at some of<span data-color=var(--blue-10)> the </span>best lessons that we can learn from him:</p><h3>1.
